This is a demonstration and a Rust client for https://adventure.land/ , a MMORPG where you write javascript to automate your adventures.

This project has two entirely separate goals:
- to provide an easy-to-copy model for languages besides javascript with Adventure Land; see [porting-to-other-languages/](porting-to-other-languages/README.md) for how to use it that way, and also how it actually works
- to be a working Rust client for Adventure Land; i.e. a program in Rust that can actually play the game; see [README-running](README-running.md) for how to just use it as a client

As of this writing (7 Jun 2025), it is far more the former than the latter; the client is only a copy of the default code that comes with the game, which is very very stupid.
